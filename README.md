# prisoners_riddle
This is a Python code I to calculate the probability of a set of prisoners escaping based on this Veritasium video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA.

The code uses Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of encountering a situation where no group has more than 50 boxes. The result turns out to be around 0.33.
